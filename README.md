**Aim**: To study and implement operators in c++

**Theory:** Operators in C++ are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on data, enabling tasks like arithmetic, comparisons, and logical evaluations. They are categorized into several types:

**-Arithmetic Operators:** Used for basic math operations, including +, -, *, /, and %.

**-Relational Operators:** Used for comparisons, such as ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=.

**-Logical Operators:** Allow combining conditions, using &&, ||, and !.

**-Bitwise Operators:** Perform operations on bits, including &, |, ^, ~, <<, and >>.

**-Assignment Operators:** Assign values and can perform operations like =, +=, -=, *=, and /=.

**-Increment/Decrement Operators:** Increase or decrease a variable's value by one (++ and --).
